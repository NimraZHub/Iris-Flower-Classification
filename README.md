# Iris-Flower-Classification
This is a data science project on the Iris dataset. It involves data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning classification using the KNN algorithm to predict flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica). The model achieved 100% accuracy with evaluation through confusion matrix and classification report.
